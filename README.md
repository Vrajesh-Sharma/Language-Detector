Language Detector
Author: Vrajesh Sharma

This repository implements a language detector using Multinomial Naive Bayes, a widely-used machine learning algorithm for text classification. The code leverages Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and CountVectorizer to achieve this functionality.

->Key Features:

-Data Preprocessing: Loads language data from a CSV file, handles missing values, and ensures consistent data format.
-Feature Engineering: Converts textual data into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
-Model Training and Evaluation: Splits data into training and testing sets, trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, and evaluates its performance.
-Interactive User Input: Allows users to input text and predicts its language.

->Future Enhancements:

-Utilize a larger dataset for improved model generalizability.
-Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for potential performance optimization.
-Explore alternative classification algorithms for comparison.
-Implement error handling for robustness.
-Consider deploying the model as a web service or API.

->Getting Started:

-Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Vrajesh-Sharma/language-detector.git
-Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
-Prepare data: Place your language data in a CSV file named Languages.csv.
-Run the script: python language_detector.py
-Enter text prompts when prompted to test language prediction.
